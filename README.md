# R for Bioinformatics course_work (2024â€“2025)

This repository contains the completed coursework for the **"R for Bioinformatics"** module as part of my MSc Bioinformatics program. The project showcases data analysis skills using R, including custom scripting, statistical evaluation, DNA sequence analysis, object-oriented programming, and microarray gene expression profiling.

## Contents

- R_Assessment_2025.Rmd â€” Source R Markdown file
- R_Assessment_2025.html â€” Rendered HTML report (full output)
- GSE9476_series_matrix.txt â€” Gene expression data
- GSE9476_meta_info.txt  â€” Sample metadata
- Supporting scripts and figures

## Key Topics Covered
### Q1: R Programming Concepts
- Overview of R in bioinformatics
- Basic data structures: vectors, matrices, data frames
- Data types in R: numeric, character, logical, factor

### Q2: DNA Sequence Analysis
- Custom R functions to:
  - Calculate sequence length
  - Compute GC content
  - Identify sequences with high GC content
  - Filter sequences above 50% GC
### Q3: S4 Object-Oriented Programming
- Defined a `Gene` S4 class
- Created gene objects (e.g., BRCA1)
- Developed a method for average expression per base

### Q4: Modified Fibonacci Simulation
- Simulated bacterial population growth using a recursive pattern
- Analyzed divisibility and total population over 20 generations

### Q5: Microarray Expression Analysis (GSE9476 Dataset)
- AML vs. Control sample classification
- Statistical summaries (mean, SD, min, max) by group
- Visualization: boxplots, scatterplots, Venn diagrams
- DEG filtering using:
  - Custom t-tests
  - `limma` package
- Final output includes counts of up- and down-regulated DEGs
